    "During the past year, equity markets have seen a strong boom. Led by big technology companies, their continued revenue and user growth have pushed the S&P 500 to new heights. This can be seen from the 2019 gains the SPY had, hovering over a gain of 10% year-over-year. On the flip side, the retail industry has not been doing so well. As consumer trends have shifted away from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores into tough competition such as Amazon, it’s no secret that they were poised for diminished growth and increased obsolescence in years to come.\n",
    "During March, many states locked-down in order to combat the pandemic which continued for many months. This has been seen to have saved thousands of lives but resulted in a serious economic downturn for the US economy, especially the consumer retail industry. As lockdowns kept customers at home and away from stores, valuations across the retail industry were slashed, revenues cut, and future guidance eliminated. For this project, we will be focusing on how the implications of the coronavirus pandemic vary across businesses within the consumer retail industry. The different businesses are grouped by small (<500 M), medium(500M <X< 1𝐵), and large cap valuations(>1B). We suspected that small and medium cap companies performed especially poorly in comparison to large cap companies and have had a diminished recovery in both profitability and valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to begin our analysis, we decided to use iexcloud, a financial data API to collect all of the data.  In our analysis, we focused on how companies' valuations and earnings have changed in relation to the general market's performance. This will give us an understanding of how different sized companies' valuation and earnings have changed as a result of the coronavirus while holding general market performance constant. We created a multi-linear regression model using different metrics of P/E (Price/Earnings) in comparison to beta to look at the relationship between earnings at a 6 month beta period. We also used a regression model for the companies’ market cap to their own beta at different  periods to see the changes to valuation per market cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting our analysis and looking at the results, we were surprised to find that beta and market cap have no correlation according to our data set. This can be because of the unique impact the coronavirus has had across all sectors and industries and general market trends being prioritized rather than company performance . Small and medium cap companies have all seen a bust and a boom brought on through economic shutdowns and true company catalysts for gains and losses have been slightly discredited as investor confidence has plummeted. We decided to look into a different valuation model, P/B (Price\\book) and found a very weak correlation. In our second analysis, we decided to look at the earnings performance of the consumer retail companies in their relative mkt cap buckets. We found a moderately negative correlation coefficient (-0.3799) on the overall relationship between P/E to enterprise value/ revenue as well as a strongly negative correlated relationship (-0.8582) between P/E and EV/EBITDA. This suggests that investors have turned away from traditional valuation metrics, and acceptable earnings premiums, into a highly speculative and over-inflated market where large cap companies receive a premium valuation and appeal insulated from their performance.\n",

    "Our dataset was created by making requests to an API called Iexcloud that contains financial information. Each observation in our dataset is a retail company that is publicly traded on the Americans markets, and each column is a common financial statistic such as percent change over various periods of time, market capitalization, and number of employees. We personally funded the creation of this dataset by signing up for a subscription to the API, which has a limited number of requests and is why our API key is hidden. Much of the data in this dataset is public information that has been compiled for the ease of financial analysis. By using this API to gain information about these American companies, we can cover a lot of important information on stock performance over the past year. We think that variety of the companies in the set, with their various market capitalizations, earnings, and business models, enable us to better understand and contextualize the purpose of our anaylsis, the economic implications of the coronavirus on the retail trade industry.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will be focusing on proving that small and medium sized companies have had the toughest time recovering and that our economy is at level below than what the SPY suggests. We will be looking at the valuation of a company vs how it has been performing in proportion to the market. We expect to find that larger companies have been closer to a beta of 1 and smaller companies to be at a smaller number. We don't expect the beta to reach over 1 since the industry has had difficulty recovering in the midst of changing consumer trends. For this analysis, we will complete similar summary statistics and data analysis as we attempt to determine the linear relationship between these variables. We will start by looking at the distributions of both of these variables independently through the usage of summary statistics such as mean, median, first quartile, third quartile, variance, and a scatterplot visualiziation. For our data analysis, we will calculate the covariance, and correlation coefficients between these two variables, by first separating the companies into buckets based on their market cap (<500m, 500m-1.5b, >1.5b), and then creating regression models for these variables for each container. This will yield us three different correlation coefficients, one for each bucket. Finally, to determine significance we will conduct a hypothesis test for correlation.\n",

    "For this analysis, we are going to be looking at the share price change within the last 6 month vs a company's P/E ratio. We hope to find a positive correlation on average across the board as the market has been recovering since the March lows and P/E ratios have been seen to be increasing as more companies within the consumer retail industry stabilize their revenue streams. We do expect that the P/E ratio will be lower in our dataset since we are looking at the consumer retail, a heavily impacted industry. The positive correlation will appear lower for smaller market cap companies as small and mid size companies have been especially hit and draw little excitement in the recovery of the market. We are going to be seeing the earnings multiple be at a premium for larger cap companies. We will once again determine the mean, median, first quartile, third quartile, variance and scatterplot visualizations for each variable independently. However, we will now view these 4 relationships to get a strong idea for the spread. For each relationship, we will determine the covariance, correlation coefficient and conduct correlation hypothesis tests to determine the significance of each relationship. Also we will still use these buckets of market cap, so we will get 3 different correlation coefficients for each, one for each bucket. Finally, we will use these four variables to create a multiple variable linear regression with the dependent variable being the profitability of a company, which will create a strong model for determining the profitability of a company. \n"

    "**Interpretation and Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In analysis 1, we found no correlation between each bucket of market capitalizations and the beta, which was contrary to our initial hypothesis. We believed that there would be a strong correlation between valuation of a company and its volatility. That is why we choose to use market cap and P/B as it gives two different perspectives on valuation of a company. The market cap talks about the actual total valuation of the company while the P/B gives us insight into the premium on valuation in comparison to the actual book value. When looking at our results for the different buckets in relation to market cap, they all returned a correlation coefficient of 0. We then decided to look at price to book, another metric that gives insight into the asset premium of a company. We found a low correlation on this front as well. It is important to note that the 3rd bucket (large mkt cap) had a stronger correlation than in the other buckets. This could explain why the general correlation coefficient is closer to the 3rd, largest market cap bucket. Overall, there was little evidence suggested from our data that there is any relationship between the relative valuation of a company and its volatility. We expected to find that smaller capped companies would have had larger betas as market swings have especially hurt mid and small capped companies. This can be seen by the diminished recovery of the Russel 2000, the industry standard for small and mid sized american companies. We suspect that could be a result of speculative market size “buckets” and we should look to revisit this analysis by making more statistically significant bucket segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For analysis 2, we found a moderately negative correlation coefficient (-0.3799) on the overall relationship between P/E to enterprise value/ revenue as well as a strongly negative correlated relationship (-0.8582) between P/E and EV/EBITDA. We then examined the P/E ratio vs EV/ EBITDA for the three different market capitalizations to see if there were any discrepancies. We found that as market cap increased, our r-squared value gradually decreased. This can be attributed to companies that have higher P/E anticipate higher growth and may be undervalued as indicated from a lower EV/ EBITDA ratio. Investors typically have target prices for high growth companies at a much higher price point than the current market consensus. As market capitalization increases, there is slightly less of a correlation between the P/E ratio and EV/EBITDA as many of these bigger consumer retail companies can be in both the mature and declining operating stages of the business cycle. A declining business could have lower earnings while the valuation of the company could remain steadfast, decreasing the correlation between the two variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "When examining these discrepancies between different market cap companies with the implications of the coronavirus pandemic, we are able to see two major takeaways. First, the effects of investor emotion and sentiment are now at an all time high as there is extreme uncertainty and speculation about both the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the potential recovery once the dust settles. We see that large cap companies have a low correlation between their P/E and EV/EBITDA ratio as their earnings do not relatively affect the company’s overall outlook and trajectory as much as the smaller cap companies are. This is another reason why smaller companies experience high stock volatility, which has only been exacerbated by the immense amount of uncertainty in today’s market.\n",
